Currently only works for gathering and only while you're on the actual gathering page

Paste this code into the console window to make it start logging ( press F12, copy paste and enter )

If you want to make it work for other tradeskills just change the fruit names to whatever resource names your tradeskill has. Use the singular versions !! For example use Cotton and not Cottons.
